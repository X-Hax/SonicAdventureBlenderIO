# Texturename List
![](../img/ui_texturenamelist.png){ align=right }

The sonic adventure games utilize texture name lists to select textures from various texture lists and draw them on the model. The addon has full support for this via texture name lists. The texturing process is documented [here](../guides/texturing.md).

The texturename list uses the [common list setup](./lists.md).

They are found on Scenes and Objects, and are stored within worlds.
